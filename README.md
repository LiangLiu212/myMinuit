# Hidden Answer Minuit

A [Blind analysis](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C030908/papers/TUIT001.pdf) is a measurement which is performed without looking at the answer. Blind analysesare the optimal way to reduce or eliminate experimenterâ€™s bias, the unintended biasing of a result in a particular direction. This package is a implementation of the hidden answer technique by modifing the TMinuit according to [Root user guide](https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html#adding-a-class-with-a-shared-library)
